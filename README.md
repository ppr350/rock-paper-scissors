The Odin Project Project - "Rock, Paper, Scissors"
(Foundation Course)

The Odin Project foundation course project "Rock, Paper, Scissors" assignment is a console based project played directly on the browwer.

The index.html will be mainly untouched.

I will try to implememt the newly-learned problem solving skills to tackle this project. To think like a programmer, and use pseudocode to lay out steps to help writing the program, also break down problems into manageable subproblems.

The outcome of this project is a playable, text-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game without GUI.
