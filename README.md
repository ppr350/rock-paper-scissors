The Odin Project Project - "Revisiting Rock, Paper, Scissors"
(Foundations Course)

This is an improved version of the previous Rock Paper Scissors game that I have done. Instead of relying on user input of the previous version. This UI version can be played by clicking buttons. User can also enter his/her name but that is not compulsory. This project used HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The Odin Project's assignment requests student to use DOM manipulation to write the code. The learning outcome is to use the skills I have learned so far from The Odin Project and other places.

A new branch was made for this new improved UI version; and it was merged into the main branch when finished.
